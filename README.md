# Plant-Disease-Detection-System
This project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of accurately detecting plant diseases from images of crop leaves using deep learning techniques. Leveraging a large-scale dataset from Kaggle and a CNN-based model, the system classifies leaf images into 38 distinct categories, including various diseases and healthy conditions.

The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early identification of plant diseases, thereby reducing crop loss and improving yield quality through timely intervention.
